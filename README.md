# Standard-Libraries-in-Python
Python has standard in built packages to make code easier, here let see some basic packages like math, random, datetime, os etc.
Modules, Packages and Standard Libraries
•	Functions help us in making the code more reusable, but to an extent. There is a catch when working with function. And that catch is, functions can’t be use outside the file or program in which they have been defined. 

What is the Module?
•	A module is nothing but a Python file, in which you write all the functions, variables or any code that are like subtask focusing on solving one main task.
What is Package?
•	Module can have multiple function and any piece of code to solve the task that the module is responsible for. If we have multiple related modules like module name one, module name two modules, then you can combine them into one package and this is what are packages in Python. A package is essentially a collection of modules that are related and a module can be thought of a collection of functions and some variables and codes that are related to solve this task.
•	There are two types of packages. 1. Standard Libraries 2. User defined Libraries.
